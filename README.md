    <b>The AtendeBem project is a triage and care system that organizes patients into a priority queue based on clinical and social criteria, such as pain level, age, and special conditions (such as pregnancy or disability). The goal is to ensure that patients with the greatest need are seen first. The program allows patients to register, automatically calculates priority based on the information provided, sorts patients in descending order according to urgency, and displays the organized queue. It simulates, in a simple and objective way, a humanized and efficient care system focused on the health area.</b>
